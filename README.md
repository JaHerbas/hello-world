# hello-world

Hi there, I'm Javier, a geophysicist that has worked in the Oil and Gas industry for a while analyzing seismic and well data. I'm originally from Venezuela. Addicted to training and sports, so finding it a bit hard during this lockdown. The company I work for is shutting down so now I will have the time finally to get into the data science world, hence why I am here.
